# Freezer-Monitor-FeatherWing-PCB
A custom FeatherWing to monitor my freezer door and text me if it is left open.

Code for this based on the Feather Huzzah is found here: https://github.com/n7jti/Arduino/tree/master/FreezerDoorMonitor

This board as been tested and works (not necessarily with the same code) with the following Adafruit Feathers:
* Feather Huzzah: https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821
* WICED Feather: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3056

I'm also working on an AmazonIoT version of the software on the WICED, but that comes later. 

Additionally, this is based on work done by Adafruit: Adafruit invests time and resources that supports this open source design, Please support Adafuit
and open-source hardare by purchasing by purchasing products from Adafruit!
